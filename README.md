C++ implementation of the closest point method for PDEs on manifolds with interior (and exterior) boundary conditions. This code accompanies the paper "A Closest Point Method for PDEs on Manifolds with Interior Boundary Conditions for Geometry Processing".

## Building

The following dependencies, [Polyscope](https://polyscope.run/), [LBFGS++](https://lbfgspp.statr.me/) and [fcpw](https://github.com/rohan-sawhney/fcpw) will be downloaded when you clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nathandking/cpm-ibc.git
```

The remaining dependencies ([Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)) are recommended to be downloaded from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```
brew install eigen
brew install boost
```

Make a new directory for builds for better code separation. ccmake is used to build the project. You should simply need to run the following commands:
```
mkdir build 
cd build/
cmake .. #choose the desired options (see below), configure, and generate
make 
```
---

## Running Examples

Once you build, the examples in the examples/ and convergence_studies/ directories will reside in build/bin/. To run an example simply run the name as a command from within the build folder. For example:
```
./bin/DiffusionCurvesCodimZero
```

## Options

BUILD_CUSTOM_SOLVER: If ON, use our partially matrix-free linear system solver. If OFF, option of BUILD_EIGEN_SPARSELU will appear.

BUILD_EIGEN_SPARSELU: If ON, use Eigen's direct solver, SparseLU. If OFF, use Eigen's BiCGSTAB iterative solver.

BUILD_ENABLE_SPARSE_GRID_SUPPORT: (Note: you must also set USE_SPARSE_GRID to ON). If ON, use our memory-efficient sparse-grid construction of the computational tube. If OFF, use our less memory-efficient, but faster construction of the computational tube.

USE_POLYSCOPE: If ON, visualization will occur using [Polyscope](https://polyscope.run/). If OFF, no visualization will occur (useful for running convergence_studies/ or on remote servers).

All other options are for included libraries.
